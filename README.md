# **Hotel Booking System**

## Description

This **Hotel Booking System** is a full-stack web application designed to facilitate the process of booking rooms online. Built with **Spring Boot** for the backend and **React** for the frontend, the system allows users to explore room options, filter by categories, make reservations, and manage bookings easily.

- **Motivation:** The motivation for creating this project stemmed from the need for a seamless and efficient online hotel reservation platform.
- **Why was this built?** The project was developed to provide a real-world solution to booking challenges that hotels face. By integrating modern technologies, we aimed to create a user-friendly system that simplifies both customer and hotel staff experiences.
- **Problem it solves:** It addresses issues like complex room booking processes, unorganized payment handling, and ineffective communication between customers and hotel management.
- **What did I learn?** Through this project, I learned how to effectively integrate frontend (React) with backend (Spring Boot), handle payment systems, implement user authentication, and build scalable full-stack web applications.
